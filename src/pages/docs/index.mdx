# Introduction

Tesfy provides a simple but complete solution to develop A/B Tests and Feature Flags on both Server and Client Side without relying in any storage layer while providing the best possible performance.

## The problem

Nowdays there is no a **mondern**, **lightweight**, **easy to use** and **free** A/B Testing and Feature Flag solution. With most of them you end up paying too much or including a lot of code into your bundle.
Since performance plays a major role in the success of any app it's important to ship the less code as possible and optimize computations. Retaining users is crucial to improving conversions. Slow sites have a negative impact on revenue, and the opposite is also true.
